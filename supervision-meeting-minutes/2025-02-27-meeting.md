# Meeting notes

## Demo

    - Clicking on a module takes you to the file explorer module.
    - What do we do about the graphs? The individual modules move around too much in the graph.
    - When do users look at this?
        - Right before pull requests.
    - We should show the diff compared to git.
    - We should integrate a view selector or something like it.
    - We should clone zeegy.
    
    - Maybe in the future, we should be able to detect which view has had a change.

    - Does any of the Force directed graph algorithms allow for some amount of determinism.
